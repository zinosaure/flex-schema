# Library Verification Report

## Summary
✅ **All library functionality has been verified and is working correctly.**

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Invalid Classifier in pyproject.toml
- **Issue**: `Development Status :: Released` is not a valid PyPI classifier
- **Fix**: Changed to `Development Status :: 4 - Beta`
- **Impact**: Package can now be properly built and installed

## Test Results

### Comprehensive Test Suite
All 20 tests passed successfully (100% success rate):

1. ✅ Basic Schema creation
2. ✅ Schema.ident() auto-generates ID and timestamp
3. ✅ Basic Flex class instantiation
4. ✅ Field validation - nullable=False
5. ✅ Field constraint - min_length
6. ✅ Field constraint - max_length
7. ✅ Field constraint - pattern validation
8. ✅ List field with item_type constraint
9. ✅ Callback functions
10. ✅ Nested Flex models
11. ✅ to_dict() method
12. ✅ to_json() method
13. ✅ update() method
14. ✅ evaluate() returns validation errors
15. ✅ Integer and float field validation
16. ✅ Boolean field validation
17. ✅ Flexmodel has id property
18. ✅ Flexmodel has updated_at property
19. ✅ Complex nested example (from README)
20. ✅ Min/max constraints for numbers

## Features Verified

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Schema definition with `Schema()` and `Schema.ident()`
- ✅ Field types: str, int, float, bool, list, tuple
- ✅ Nested models (Flex and Flexmodel)
- ✅ Default values
- ✅ Nullable field validation

### Validation Features
- ✅ Type checking
- ✅ Required fields (nullable=False)
- ✅ Pattern matching with regex
- ✅ Min/max length for strings and lists
- ✅ Min/max values for numbers
- ✅ List item type validation
- ✅ Nested model validation

### Advanced Features
- ✅ Callback functions for value transformation
- ✅ Auto-generated IDs and timestamps
- ✅ Serialization (to_dict(), to_json())
- ✅ Model updates
- ✅ Error reporting via evaluate()

### Flexmodel Features
- ✅ ID property
- ✅ Updated_at property
- ✅ Auto-generated UUIDs
- ✅ Timestamp tracking

## Example Output

The basic.py example works correctly and produces valid output:

```json
{
  "_id": "f2551110-41be-418f-bdbe-ba5ef8ec54af",
  "_updated_at": "2025-10-11T23:50:26.397671+00:00",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01",
  "login": {
    "_id": "05476639-fbcd-4477-a611-7ce5d3ea8093",
    "_updated_at": "2025-10-11T23:50:26.397594+00:00",
    "username": "johndoe",
    "password": "securepassword"
  },
  "tags": ["user", "admin"],
  "is_active": true,

}
```

## Conclusion

The flex-schema library is functioning correctly. All core features, validation mechanisms, and advanced functionality have been tested and verified. The only issue found was a minor configuration error in the pyproject.toml file, which has been fixed.

The library successfully:
- Defines schemas with various field types and constraints
- Validates data according to schema rules
- Supports nested models and complex data structures
- Provides callbacks for value transformation
- Generates proper error messages for validation failures
- Serializes models to dictionaries and JSON
- Auto-generates IDs and timestamps for Flexmodel instances

All examples from the README work as documented.
